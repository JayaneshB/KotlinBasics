/*
Coffee will wake you up but also quench your thirst. There are different types of coffee, Arabica and Robusta. But since you donâ€™t really care about that, you just go to the coffee shop and ask for a coffee, which they will happily provide.

You will then drink the coffee to both wake you up and quench your thirst.

Implement this in a program.
